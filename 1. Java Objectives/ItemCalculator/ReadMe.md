# ItemCalculater with Item as input.

This is my second Java script.

Main objectives were to create a calculater class with get/set methods and then use try/catch in main script:
- Read inn item name, quantity and price for item 2 and item 2
- Use try/catch to convert String to integer
- Create to item objects with the input values

In additon, I implemented a do-while loop to failsafe input statements, such that "diejbdejb" cannot be used as input when expencted integer numbers.

Work is done using Netbeans (Java with Ant).
